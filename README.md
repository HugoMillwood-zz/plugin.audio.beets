# plugin.audio.beets
*A Kodi addon for streaming music from a [beets](https://github.com/sampsyo/beets) library*

A joint effort between [Hugo](https://github.com/HugoMillwood) and [PÃ¤r](https://github.com/parski).

###Known bugs:

**FLAC only seems to work with Linux at the moment** - OS X and OpenELEC seem to have codec issues with FLAC and metadata. Very strange. See: http://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=218576

**Sort of stupid sorting** - This plugin doesn't even alphabet. I'll sort it out later *HAR HAR HAR*

**Search doesn't work** - It's not implemented yet.

**Next song is next next song** - I have no idea why this happens

**All songs is no songs** - This is not implemented and even if it was it would be really slow if you have a lot of music. I'm only implementing this because it feels like it's a feature that should be around to give the impression that you have browsing options.
