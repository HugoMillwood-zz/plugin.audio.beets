# plugin.audio.beets
*less broken edition*

An XBMC plugin for streaming audio from a beets web server.

[Hugo](https://github.com/HugoMillwood) wanted a plugin but his was too broken so I forked his repo and made a less broken one. It's still pretty broken.

###Known bugs:

**Sort of stupid sorting** - This plugin doesn't even alphabet. I'll sort it out later *HAR HAR HAR*

**Search doesn't work** - It's not implemented yet. Just search manually for now

**Next song is next next song** - I have no idea why this happens

**All songs is no songs** - This is not implemented and even if it was it would be really slow if you have a lot of music. I'm only implementing this because it feels like it's a feature that should be around to give the impression that you have browsing options
